dna-engine is a lightweight easy-to-use UI library enabling developers to rapidly build maintainable
JavaScript applications.

## A) Bookstore Example
Designate templates with the `dna-template` class, and put the templates directly into the HTML
of your web page.&nbsp; Use the element's `id` to indicate the name of the template.&nbsp;
Enclose data fields in double tildes `~~`.

### 1. HTML for book template
```html
<h1>Featured Books</h1>
<div id=book class=dna-template>
   <h2>~~title~~</h2>
   Author: <cite>~~author~~</cite>
</div>
```

Then call the `dna.clone()` function to insert a copy of the template into the DOM.&nbsp; The
supplied JSON data object populates the fields of the template.

### 2. JavaScript call to add book node
```js
dna.clone('book', { title: 'The DOM', author: 'Jan' });
```

The new clone element replaces the template.&nbsp; The original template is detached from
the DOM and kept for additional cloning.

### 3. Resulting HTML with clone
```html
<h1>Featured Books</h1>
<div class=book>
   <h2>The DOM</h2>
   Author: <cite>Jan</cite>
</div>
```

Need to clone the template multiple times?&nbsp;  Simply pass an array of data objects into the
`dna.clone()` function.
